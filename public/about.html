              What Are Goofy Glizzies?
            </h1>
            <p class="p-text">
              Goofy Glizzies were created after a science experiment in the lockdown of 2020 went wrong.
              Some drunk biologists at a barbeque party decided to see if they could create living food, they exposed the glizzies to too much radiation and they grew too powerful. The glizzies ended up eating everyone at the party and now they are rampaging around Britain, terrorizing the unknowing victims.

            <p class="p-text">
              Fine. Goofy Glizzies is a collection of 10,000 randomly (but influenced by rarity traits) generated hot dog themed NFTs living on the Polygon Blockchain, they can be worth drastically more than others if a Glizzy has a combination of extreamly rare traits.

              Rarity
            </h1>
            <p class="p-text">
              All Glizzies are made up of a combination of 9 traits that all vary in rarity; Background, Sausage, Bun, Arms, Mouth, Eyes, Eyebrows and Hair/Hats. The Rarity of Glizzy will affect its value and since all Glizzies are the same price to mint, theres some good money to be made! You can view how rare your Glizzy is by going to open see and looking at the properties tab, you can also view how much people are selling their own Glizzy with similar traits to yours. The discord is a great place to discus prices.

              Why Should I Mint A Glizzy?
            </h1>
            <p class="p-text">
              Other than the usual benifts of flipping NFTs the Glizzy mint price that you see now will increase every 100 mints, this means if you bought one at 50 Matic and the price increased to 100, you could sell your Glizz for anywhere up to 100 Matic and it would be a good deal for the buyer as its cheaper than minting. If your Glizzy is also rare than you could sell above the minting price and buyers would still be inclined to buy yours instead of minting their own. 
            </p>
            <p class="p-text">
              If you own 1 or more Glizzies you are eligble to enter the giveaways that we host in the discord! Note that to keep the giveaways fair, owning mutiple Glizzies will not increase your number of entries.

              How Do I Mint A Glizzy?
            </h1>
            <p class="p-text">
              Its simple! Head back to the main page, click conect and a MetaMask notification should pop up, sign in and make sure your connected to the Polygon network, then you can decide how many Glizzies you want to mint, click mint, another pop up will appear then you can click confirm when your happy! To see your Glizzies go to OpenSea and sign in, the NFTs will apear on your profile! 
            </p>
            <p class="p-text">
              If the NFT shows as "Glizzy(Hidden)" This means we are still in our pre-sale phase, in the pre-sale phase you will be able to sell your minted Glizzies but we dont recomend this as you might undervalue your NFT when the Metadata is revealed (Metadata is the data that stores the traits and image of a NFT, ALL GLIZZIES ARE UNIQUE) The reveal date will be announced when 50 Glizzies have been minted (Likely 1 month after the goal is reached) when the Metadata is revealed the image and properties will show on OpenSea and you will be able to see how rare your Glizzy is. You will see when the reveal date is in our discord.

            <p class="p-text">
              We aim to do many things in the coming year like partner with charities and donate 10% of our sale revenue to organisations that need it. At this point in time Goofy Glizzies doesnt have any utility so we'd love to make something to reward the buyer for holding their NFTs like a game or merchandice, any ideas for what people want to see would greatly appreciated. 
            </p>
            <p class="p-text">
              As we said before, the more mints, the higher the price, the cost to mint a Glizzy will increase as time goes on, increasing the value of the pre-existing Glizzies, so dont wait and mint yours ASAP.
